# At some point, columns defined with a type of "blob" began to be
# created as "oid" columns rather than "bytea" columns in Postgres.
# The spring_session_attributes table had a "blob" column that we
# need to be "bytea", so drop the old column and create it with
# the right type of necessary.
# Note that there's no need to worry about migrating data, because if
# it had been created as an "oid", we never would have successfully
# inserted data into it in the first place.
